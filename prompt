Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank), Malaysia's largest bank, is reportedly evaluating strategic options for its insurance arm, Etiqa. Currently, Maybank holds a 69% stake in Etiqa, while Belgian insurer Ageas SA owns the remaining 31%. Sources suggest that a potential transaction could value Etiqa at up to $4 billion.
One possibility under consideration is Maybank acquiring Ageas's stake to gain full ownership of Etiqa. This move would allow Maybank to consolidate its position in the insurance sector and potentially prepare Etiqa for an initial public offering (IPO) in the future.

Etiqa has been a significant contributor to Maybank's profitability, generating RM1.1 billion in pre-tax profit in 2023, which accounts for approximately 9% of the bank's total pre-tax earnings. The insurance industry in Malaysia presents growth opportunities, especially among underinsured segments such as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and vulnerable communities
