Vietnam Technological & Commercial JSB, known as Techcombank and backed by Warburg Pincus, would consider selling a 15% stake to the right strategic investor, according to Chief Executive Officer Jens Lottner.

The lender, Vietnam’s biggest listed private bank, was previously looking for capital, but now “we’re looking more for capabilities and especially when it comes to technology,” Lottner said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. “15% is probably something we could actually come up with,” he added.

“There’s a lot of money coming in from Singapore, Japan and Korea,” and Techcombank is looking for companies which can help it “get into these trade corridors,” Lottner said. Foreign investors currently have a total stake of about 22% in the Hanoi-based bank, according to the CEO. Vietnam imposes a foreign ownership cap of 30% on banks, so Techcombank would need to see some shareholders sell before it could offer the 15% stake.
