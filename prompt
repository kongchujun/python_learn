Sale process for Bank Commonwealth down to two bidders, Bajaj Finance withdraws

The sale process for PT Bank Commonwealth, the Indonesian subsidiary of Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CommBank), has narrowed down to two bidders following the withdrawal of Bajaj Finance. The remaining contenders are Japanese financial services provider J Trust and Taiwan's Cathay Financial. Bajaj Finance exited the bidding process due to pending approval from Indonesia's Financial Services Authority (OJK), which prevented the submission of binding bids.

Both J Trust and Cathay Financial already have a presence in Indonesia through their respective stakes in local banks. As of December 31, 2022, Bank Commonwealth reported a loss of IDR 440.3 billion (USD 29.3 million), an increase from the previous year's loss of IDR 186.6 billion (USD 12.4 million). Despite financial challenges, the bank maintained a capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 31.71%, surpassing the industry average of 25.63%. The bank plans to continue innovating its products and services in 2023, including its bancassurance partnership with PT FWD Insurance Indonesia and investment offerings via its CommBank SmartWealth app.
