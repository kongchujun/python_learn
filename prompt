Blackstone Inc. and Warburg Pincus are in the early stages of weighing strategic options including a sale of IntraFi, a fintech that helps people secure their bank deposits, according to people familiar with the matter.

The alternative-asset managers have begun talking to investment banks about soliciting interest in IntraFi — which could fetch $12 billion or more in any transaction — in early 2025, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing non-public information. The company could appeal to large financial technology firms such as exchanges, the people said. IntraFi may also be a candidate for an initial public offering, one of the people said.
